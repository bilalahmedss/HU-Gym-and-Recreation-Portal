For our database systems project, we planned on making a portal for the HU community that would serve as a one window operation for all the fitness related options at Habib University. This includes sports, gym and other recreational facilities.

The portal will let community members pay their gym fee, signup for sports events, register their teams, signup for locker issuance.

Their are two different portals, one for the community members and other for the admins. Admins can view events, change and add events and can approve gym and locker issuance.
